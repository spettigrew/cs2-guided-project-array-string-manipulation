"""
Arrays - lists 
Search - is x in DS - O(n)
Insert - can not leave a 'blank spot' O(n) - linear
Delete - same as insert ^
Access - I know where the data is, how fast can I retrieve it?
access them in O(1) time because they are next to each other in the indices. Array address + 0. It starts at the indice of 0.
Static arrays - set (initial array of 10, if you want to add an item to equal 11, you must make a new array of 10 to add the one item.)
Dynamic array - O(n) - still can have an open slot, but easier to move items
